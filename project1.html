    <h2><span>A Story About "Hiring" High School Kids</span></h2>
    <p>
        Back when I attended high school I took web development courses, all
        the way up to Web Coding Three. I unfortunately only remember enough
        at this point to know I used to be better at web coding, but even when
        I did "know" what I was doing, I was still just a high school kid.
    </p>

    <h3><span>Enter: Opportunistic Entrepreneur</span></h3>

    <p>
        Our teacher for Web Three had the idea of having us construct an
        actual website for a real person, and managed to find someone who
        was starting a massage business. After figuring out what the 
        client generally wanted for their website, I was chosen as the
        representative (among the students in the class) to communicate with
        the client via email whenever we needed files, feedback, clarification,
        etc. This also meant that the client would contact me whenever they
        had an idea or wanted something, which would come back to bite me.

    <h3><span>The Dumpster Fire</span></h3>

    <p>
        As it turns out, this client already had some of a website made
        from a service that makes templated websites, think SquareSpace.
        Naturally when our client figured out that they could replace the
        service they were paying for with free labor from the local high
        school, they jumped on it. That led to me and the other students parsing
        through this nightmare generated code for about a week before deciding
        that starting completely from scratch would be better than trying
        to work with this Frankenstein abomination.

    <h3><span>More Than I Could Chew</span></h3>

    <p>
        Big surprise, but making a website for someone trying to promote a
        business can be a full time job. On top of having other classes and
        an actual job, I was drowning in work to get done. I remember staying
        up for a couple of nights to get a logo photoshopped together for the
        client because it was the only time I could find to work on it. To
        make matter worse, my other "co-workers" were also high school
        students, so I would frequently have to let our client know why
        certain things weren't done when they said they would be and take the
        brunt of the heat for it.

    <p>
        By the end of the class I was fed up with coding. Between being
        customer service at a grocery store and customer service for our
        client it was too much. I hated my classmates who constantly came up
        short on deadlines and left it to me to either buy more time or do it
        myself. I decided coding wasn't the path for me, so much so that it
        took me years before I entertained the idea of tyring it again for an
        advanced degree, and while web coding still leaves me with a bad taste,
        I've come around on the idea of programming in other languages.
